# Deep PTC mode

[中文](README.zh.md) · MIT · **1.3.0**

A collaborative DeepSeek Harness PTC preset with visible progress, focused fact lookup, semantic clarification, scoped work, evidence-based verification and lifecycle-aware background jobs.

## Choose an execution environment

Open **Settings → Plugins → Deep PTC**, choose an environment, save, and create a new **深度PTC模式** session.

| Selection | Host | Executor / tool |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automatic | Windows / macOS / Linux | PowerShell on Windows, Zsh on macOS, Bash on Linux |
| WSL Bash | Windows | Explicit `wsl.exe ... --exec bash -lc`, tool `bash` |
| PowerShell | Windows | Official native PowerShell executor, tool `pwsh` |
| Zsh | macOS / Linux | `/bin/zsh -lc` on macOS; installed `zsh` on Linux; tool `zsh` |
| Native Bash | macOS / Linux | Official Bash executor, tool `bash` |

Unsupported choices are disabled according to the Host, not the browser OS, and rejected by the Host schema. Leave the WSL distribution blank for the Windows default or enter an installed name such as `Ubuntu`. Zsh must be installed when selected on Linux.

The selection changes the real executor, tool contract and environment instructions. Executors live in a preset-local `shell` realm, independent of the global shell and other presets. Settings register a new preset revision for new sessions. Existing sessions and background jobs retain their revision: create a new session to change environment safely.

WSL source uses Linux/POSIX syntax, while file tools and `workdir` use Windows host paths. Distribution, cwd and source are distinct argv entries passed through `wsl.exe --cd`; no surrounding shell string is assembled. Login-shell configuration in the selected distribution controls Linux PATH and proxy setup. Windows environment variables are not all automatically exported into Linux.

### Sandbox behavior

Native PowerShell, Bash and Zsh use Harness sandbox, approval and process management. WSL currently supports only execution already authorized as `danger-full-access`. Confined Windows policies are refused before execution, without fallback or permission changes. The plugin does not authorize escalation.

## Working contract

- Report milestones and keep active work visible about every 30–60 seconds at tool boundaries. Combine trivial reads instead of narrating every call.
- Make a focused read-only lookup for unfamiliar installed names and locations. Ask when meaning remains ambiguous or consequential user choices change the work; search cannot define intent.
- Plan internally for small linear tasks and show concise plans for larger work. Duration does not revoke existing authorization. Explicit plan mode keeps its read-only and approval requirements.
- Use current evidence and verify changed behavior. Finish when acceptance criteria and relevant checks are satisfied; repeat checks for new changes, failures or conflicting evidence.
- Distinguish finite jobs, long-lived services and external tasks without Harness notifications. Check server readiness and continue validation. Collect relevant results before declaring completion.
- Delegate independent work deliberately, define disjoint write scopes and collect results through the actual tool's channel.

This expresses a working preference, not a grant of extra tokens, different billing or greater model capacity. Prompt compliance and quality gains still need real-task evaluation.

## Install or upgrade

Requires Node `>=24` and DSH `>=0.2.1-rc.5`. Windows desktop rc.5 was used for real WSL/PowerShell command checks. macOS/Zsh configuration, argv and tool mounting were checked; native macOS execution has not been verified on this Windows host.

```js
plugin_manager({ action: "install_bundle", target: "dsh-deep-ptc-mode@1.3.0" })
// Or from a local checkout or archive:
plugin_manager({ action: "install_bundle", target: "C:\\path\\to\\dsh-deep-ptc-mode" })
// Or target: "C:\\path\\to\\dsh-deep-ptc-mode-1.3.0.tgz"
```

Repository locator: `github:lishize20040802-rgb/dsh-deep-ptc-mode`. It installs content actually published there; a local upgrade does not publish to GitHub or npm.

Installing the same bundle updates it. Upgrading from the persona-only release requires a Host plugin reload; reopen the app if the settings card has not appeared. Installation does not change the default mode for unrelated new sessions.

Settings persist through the active profile's Cordis patch:

```yaml
- id: deep-ptc-settings
  config:
    environment: auto       # auto | wsl | powershell | zsh | bash
    wslDistribution: ''      # blank uses the Windows default
```

Prefer the UI, which uses revisioned, atomic Host form writes.

## Compatibility and development

The rc.5 PTC template has 23 top-level rows. The template differs only in persona; runtime composition replaces the two platform-switched shell tools with one isolated execution group. Planning, compaction, pruning, web and delegation settings stay intact.

Version 1.3.0 adds Host/browser code and is no longer persona-only. `compatibility.json` records the verified upstream and fixture hash. The engines range is an installation floor, not proof that every future release was tested.

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
npm test
npm run check:upstream -- /path/to/the/new/upstream/ptc.patch.yml
npm pack
```

The checker parses `!!js` as data, compares nested upstream settings and fails on drift requiring review. Tests cover platforms, argv boundaries, confined WSL refusal, atomic settings writes and stale revisions, plus preset replacement and cleanup. Real-task evaluations should measure successful completion, unnecessary questions, scope expansion, background-work collection and latency.

Main files: `cordis.patch.yml` is the settings entry; `lib/index.mjs` manages revisions; `lib/model.mjs` builds isolated execution configurations; `lib/executor.mjs` adapts WSL/Zsh; `lib/terminal.mjs` provides the Zsh tool; `lib/client.js` owns the bilingual settings card; `lib/preset.json` contains the persona and official PTC template.

Uninstall with `plugin_manager` action `remove_bundle`, target `dsh-deep-ptc-mode`. Local link installations depend on their source directory: uninstall before deleting it.
